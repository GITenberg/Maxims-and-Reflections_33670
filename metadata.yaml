description: The passing thoughts Goethe jotted down during his long, varied, and
  hectic life -- thankfully preserved on theater programs, visiting cards, draft manuscripts,
  and bills -- show him to be the last true "Renaissance man" of Europe. Although
  employed as a privy councillor at the Duke of Weimar's court, he also painted; directed
  plays; carried out research in the classics, anatomy, botany, and optics; and still
  found time to produce masterpieces in every literary genre. His 1,413 maxims and
  reflections reveal not only some of his deepest thoughts on art, ethics, literature,
  and natural science but also his immediate reactions to books, chance encounters,
  and his administrative work. With freshness and immediacy, Maxims and Reflections
  vividly conjures up Goethe the man and the genius.
